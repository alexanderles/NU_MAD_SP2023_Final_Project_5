Welcome to CampusHub! If you are new here, let me give you a quick walkthrough.

- **Organizations:** If you are an organization and have not registered yet, please do so, and you can add any upcoming events so that students can view and register for these events.
- **Students:** If you are a student looking for upcoming events in your desired club, have no worries. Just sign up as a member, and you can go to our search bar to look up the desired clubs and register for their events.
- **Calendar:** If you can not keep up with all events, have no worries again, as we have a calendar tab where you can view all the upcoming events in a calendar format.
- **Deregister:** If you want to deregister, you can easily do so by clicking on the registered event and simply click the deregister button.
- **Edit Profile:** If you ever want to edit your account, you can easily go to the profile tab and change your profile image, first and last name.
- **App Info:** Lastly, if you want to see who created this amazing app, click on the app info when you are on the profile page.
